                          preemptionStrategies indicates which constraints should a preemption satisfy.
                          The preemption algorithm will only use the next strategy in the list if the
                          incoming workload (preemptor) doesn't fit after using the previous strategies.
                          Possible values are:
                          - LessThanOrEqualToFinalShare: Only preempt a workload if the share of the preemptor CQ
                            with the preemptor workload is less than or equal to the share of the preemptee CQ
                            without the workload to be preempted.
                            This strategy might favor preemption of smaller workloads in the preemptee CQ,
                            regardless of priority or start time, in an effort to keep the share of the CQ
                            as high as possible.
                          - LessThanInitialShare: Only preempt a workload if the share of the preemptor CQ
                            with the incoming workload is strictly less than the share of the preemptee CQ.
                            This strategy doesn't depend on the share usage of the workload being preempted.
                            As a result, the strategy chooses to preempt workloads with the lowest priority and
                            newest start time first.
                          The default strategy is ["LessThanOrEqualToFinalShare", "LessThanInitialShare"].
